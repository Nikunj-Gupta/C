Q1. Signed char minimum value: -128
Explaination: Signed char can be positive or negative. we know that char 
              contains 1byte which is equal to 8bits which is in turn equal to
              2^8 charectars, mathamatically 
              1byte = 8bits = 2^8charectars
              because signed char tkes both positive and negative values 
              so half of 2^8 will be positive and other half will be negative
              2^8/2 = 128. so the minimum value is -128

Q2. Signed char maximum value: 127
Explaination: as mentioned above
              1byte = 8bits = 2^8charectars
              8bits in the sense 1st bit is signed bit and the remaining 7bits
              bits are regular bits. signed bit takes only 1 or 0.
              if u want max value of signed char assign 0 to sign bit and 1 to
              the regular bits. i.e 01111111
              so the max value of signed char is 127.
Q3. Unsigned char minimum value: 0
Explaination: Unsigned char takes non negative values so its minimum value is 0

Q4. Unsigned char maximum value: 255
Explaination: unsigned char takes only non negative values. 
              as mentioned earlier char takes 1byte = 8bits = 2^8charectars
              we assign 1 to the sign bit and also to the 7 regular bits. Then
              we have the number as 11111111. The value of this 255.

Q5. Char minimum value: -128
Explanation: char minimum value refers to signed char minimum value.
              which is -128.

Q6. Char maximum value: 127
Explanation: char maximum value refers to signed char maximum value.
              which is 127.

Q7. Signed short minimum value: -32768
Explanation: Signed short occupies a space of 2bytes=16bits=2^8charectars
              because it signed short it can take positive and negative 
              characters. so 2^8/2 = 32768.
              so minimum value is -32768.

Q8. Signed short maximum value: 32767
Explanation: assign 0 to the signed bit and assign 1 to regular bits.
              i.e 0111111111111111 
              which is equal to 32767

Q9. Unsigned short minimum value: 0
Explanation: Unsigned short takes only nonnegative values.
              so the minimum value of unsigned char is 0.

Q10. Unsigned short maximum value: 65535
Explanation: Unsigned short has 16bits. assign 1 to the sign bit and 1 to the
              regualr bits i.e 1111111111111111.
              which is euqal to 65535.

Q11. Signed int minimum value: -2147483648
Explanation: Singned int occupies 4bytes = 32bits = 2^32 charactars
             since signed int takes both positive and negative value
             so the minimum value is -2^32/2 = -2147483648

Q12. Signed int maximum value: 2147483647
Explanation: assign 0 to the sign bit and 1 to regular bits.
             so the maximi=um value is 214748367

Q13. Unsigned int minimum value: 0
Explanation: unsigned int takes non negative values.
             so the minimum value is 0

Q14. Unsigned int maximum value: 4294967295
Explanation: assign 1 to all bits i.e signed bits and regular bits.
             there will be 32bits.
             so the maximum value is 4294967295.

Q15. Signed long minimum value: -9223372036854775808
Explanation: signed long has 64bits. i.e 2^64 charectars.
             as signed long int takes both positive and negative values.
             its minimun value is -2^64/2
             which is -9223372036854775808

Q16. Signed long maximum value: 9223372036854775807
Explanation: assign 0 to the sign bit and 1 to all the regular bits
             so the maximum value is 9223372036854775807
             
Q17. Unsigned long minimum value: 0
Explanation: Unsigned long takes only non negative values. 
             so the minimum value is 0

Q18. Unsigned long maximum value: 18446744073709551615
Explanation: assign 1 to all 64bits i.e to signed bits and regualr bits
             which is equal to 188446744073709551615.

Q19. Signed long long minimum value: -9223372036854775808
Explanation: signed long long has 64bits so 2^64charactars.
             since signed long long takes positive and negative values.
             so the minimum values is -2^64/2 = -9223372036854775808.
Q20. Signed long long maximum value: 9223372036854775807
Explanation: assign 0 to sign bit and 1 to regular bits.
             so the maximum value is 9223372036854775807

Q21. Unsigned long long minimum value: 0
Explanation: unsigned long long takes non negative values.
            so the minimum value is 0

Q22. Unsigned long long maximum value: 18446744073709551615
Explanation: assign 1 to sign bit and to regular bits.
            so the maximum value is 18446744073709551615.
